# Initial Python Code Assessment

## Overview
This challenge is designed to assess your ability to write clean, correct, and efficient Python code.  
You will be presented with 20 short coding problems that test skills in:
- Problem-solving and algorithm design  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and `@dataclass` usage  
- Data wrangling with pandas  

You have 60 minutes to complete
---

## Rules
1. Work independently — we want to see your own approach and reasoning.  
2. You may use standard Python libraries (e.g., `math`, `itertools`, `collections`).  
3. You may use pandas and numpy where required.  
5. Disable AI code complete! Do not use AI assistants or online solutions (the goal is to assess your skills).

-> Settings Cog -> AI Assistance -> Untick 'Show AI powered inline completions' and 'Consented to use generative AI features'

6. Write your code in the provided Colab notebook. Each problem has a cell below to test your solution.  
7. You are free to write helper functions if you feel it improves clarity but do not change any of the function names or the marking won't work and you'll get zero for the question
8.  At the end run the marking section to submit your answers, make sure you add your name and service number

## Assessment
Your solutions will be graded automatically with unit tests provided in the notebook.  
You will be assessed on:  
- Correctness – Does your solution pass the tests?  
- Code clarity – Is your code easy to read and well-structured?

## Usage
1. Open the Colab notebook via the link above.  
2. Work through each problem in order, writing your solutions in the provided cells.  
3. Run the test cells after your solution to check if your code is correct.  
4. When finished, we will take note of your grade
5. Save your workbook in the format 'sait_initial_code_assessment-<NAME>-<SERVICENUMBER>.ipynb and upload it to this repo
